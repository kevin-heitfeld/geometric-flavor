## How to Contribute

### Reporting Issues

Found a bug or have a question?

1. Check existing [Issues](../../issues) first
2. Open a new issue with:
   - Clear description
   - Steps to reproduce (if bug)
   - Expected vs actual behavior
   - Your environment (Python version, OS)

### Suggesting Enhancements

Have an idea for improvement?

1. Open an issue with tag `enhancement`
2. Describe the feature and motivation
3. Discuss implementation approach

### Code Contributions

Ready to contribute code?

1. **Fork** the repository
2. **Create** a feature branch: `git checkout -b feature/amazing-feature`
3. **Make** your changes with clear commit messages
4. **Test** thoroughly: run all scripts, check outputs
5. **Document**: Update README and add docstrings
6. **Submit** a pull request

## Code Standards

### Python Style

- Follow PEP 8 style guide
- Use descriptive variable names
- Add docstrings to functions
- Comment complex physics calculations

### Physics Standards

- Cite papers for formulas (arXiv numbers)
- Use standard PDG values for experimental data
- Document approximations and assumptions
- Validate against known results

### Testing

Before submitting:
- Run key scripts: `stress_test_k_patterns.py`, `explain_n_ordering.py`
- Check figures are generated correctly
- Verify numerical accuracy

## Areas of Interest

### High Priority

1. **Complete fit validation**: Help analyze ongoing 18-observable fit
2. **String construction**: Build explicit CY with k=(8,6,4) pattern
3. **Neutrino sector**: Extend to seesaw mechanism
4. **Other symmetries**: Test on S₄, A₅, etc.

### Medium Priority

5. **Optimization**: Speed up differential evolution
6. **Visualization**: Interactive plots, animations
7. **Documentation**: Tutorials, examples
8. **Literature**: Comprehensive comparison

### Open Questions

- Why C = 13 in τ = 13/Δk? Deeper derivation?
- Can we derive brane positions x = (0,1,2) from topology?
- What about quark-lepton unification in SO(10)?
- How to include neutrino masses systematically?
