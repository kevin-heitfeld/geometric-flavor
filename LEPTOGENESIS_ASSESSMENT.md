# LEPTOGENESIS FROM MODULAR STRUCTURE: ASSESSMENT

**Date**: December 25, 2024  
**Status**: Tension identified, options outlined

---

## Executive Summary

We investigated whether the parameter space that successfully produces dark matter (M_R ~ 10-50 TeV, Yukawa ~ 0.4-0.6) can also generate the observed baryon asymmetry η_B ~ 6×10⁻¹⁰ through leptogenesis.

**Result**: Standard thermal leptogenesis **fails** due to strong washout. Resonant leptogenesis **could work in principle** but requires very specific mass degeneracies not yet derived from the modular structure.

---

## Key Findings

### 1. Standard Thermal Leptogenesis: ✗ FAILS

**Problem**: Strong washout parameter K ~ 10¹¹

```
Benchmark (M_R = 20 TeV):
  Yukawa: |Y_D| ~ 0.58 (from DM seesaw)
  Decay width: Γ_N ~ 263 GeV
  Hubble rate: H(T=M_R) ~ 5.6×10⁻¹⁰ GeV
  Washout: K = Γ/H ~ 4.7×10¹¹ ≫ 1

Result:
  CP asymmetry: ε ~ 1.3×10⁻²
  Efficiency: κ ~ 6×10⁻¹³ (killed by washout!)
  Baryon asymmetry: η_B ~ 4.6×10⁻¹⁵
  
Observed: η_B^obs = 6.1×10⁻¹⁰

✗ Underproduction by factor ~10⁵
```

**Physical interpretation**: The Yukawa couplings required for dark matter production are so large that heavy neutrinos equilibrate in the early universe, washing out any CP asymmetry before it can be converted to baryon number.

---

### 2. Resonant Leptogenesis: ? POSSIBLE BUT...

**Mechanism**: CP asymmetry enhanced by interference when M_1 ≈ M_2

```
Enhancement: ε_res ~ ε × M/(ΔM)

Maximum when: ΔM ~ Γ_avg (on-shell condition)
```

**Requirements** for M_R ~ 10-20 TeV:

```
Need: ΔM ~ Γ ~ 100 GeV
      ΔM/M ~ 10⁻² to 10⁻³

Current modular predictions:
  Different weights (k_i ≠ k_j): ΔM/M ~ 0.1-1 (too large)
  Radiative corrections: ΔM/M ~ 10⁻³ (marginally possible)
  Same weight, flavor split: ΔM/M ~ 0.1-1 (too large)
```

**Status**: Resonant leptogenesis **could work** if:
- Two N_R exist with M ~ 10-20 TeV
- Accidental degeneracy: ΔM ~ 100 GeV
- OR modular parameter fine-tuned

**Not yet shown**: How τ = 2.69i predicts this specific degeneracy

### 3. The Tension

There is a **fundamental tension** between:

| Requirement | Value | Consequence |
|-------------|-------|-------------|
| **Dark Matter** | Large Yukawa (Y_D ~ 0.4-0.6) | Correct relic abundance ✓ |
| **Leptogenesis** | Small washout (K < 10) | Preserve CP asymmetry ✓ |

```
Large Y_D → Large Γ_N → Large K → Washout!
```

**This is not a bug, it's physics**: You can't have both weak coupling (for leptogenesis) and strong coupling (for DM production) from the **same** particles.

---

## Options Going Forward

### **Option A: Accept Separate Mechanisms** (Most Honest)

**Position**: 
- DM from freeze-in sterile neutrinos ✓ (works beautifully)
- Baryogenesis from **different mechanism** (e.g., electroweak, GUT-scale)
- Both compatible with modular flavor, not directly connected

**Pros**:
- Honest about what works and what doesn't
- Each mechanism well-motivated independently
- No fine-tuning required

**Cons**:
- Less "unified" story
- Doesn't explain baryogenesis from modular structure

**Verdict**: **Defensible and honest**

---

### **Option B: Invoke Resonant + Fine-Tuning** (Speculative)

**Position**:
- Claim resonant leptogenesis works
- Assume accidental degeneracy ΔM/M ~ 10⁻³
- Potential anthropic argument: we live where both DM and baryons exist

**Pros**:
- Completes the cosmological trifecta
- Mathematically possible
- Anthropic reasoning increasingly accepted

**Cons**:
- Requires assumption not derived from τ = 2.69i
- Looks like fine-tuning to a referee
- No predictivity for mass spectrum

**Verdict**: **Possible but requires honest disclaimer**

---

### **Option C: Alternative Baryogenesis** (Change Mechanism)

**Position**:
- Keep DM from sterile neutrinos
- Generate baryons from **electroweak baryogenesis** or **GUT leptogenesis**
- Show both compatible with modular structure

**Mechanisms to explore**:

1. **Electroweak Baryogenesis**
   - CP violation from CKM matrix (modular?)
   - First-order phase transition
   - May need BSM to strengthen transition

2. **GUT-Scale Leptogenesis** (M_R ~ 10¹⁴ GeV)
   - Different heavy neutrinos at GUT scale
   - Not same particles as DM seesaw
   - Modular structure at both scales?

3. **Affleck-Dine Mechanism**
   - Flat direction in scalar potential
   - CP violation from modular phases?
   - Requires SUSY

**Pros**:
- Avoids tension between DM and leptogenesis
- Well-studied mechanisms
- Can still involve modular structure

**Cons**:
- Less direct connection to our DM analysis
- Requires additional structure

**Verdict**: **Worth exploring**

---

### **Option D: Multi-Component DM** (Different Particle)

**Position**:
- Sterile neutrinos are only **sub-dominant** DM component
- Dominant DM from something else (axion, moduli, etc.)
- Allows smaller Yukawa → weaker washout

**Example**: 
```
DM composition:
  20% sterile neutrinos (from smaller Y_D ~ 0.1)
  80% modular axion

Leptogenesis:
  Smaller Yukawa → K ~ 10³ instead of 10¹¹
  Washout less severe
  η_B closer to observed
```

**Pros**:
- Both DM and baryogenesis work
- Multi-component DM increasingly popular
- Modular axions natural in string theory

**Cons**:
- Requires additional DM candidate
- More complex story
- Dilutes predictivity

**Verdict**: **Interesting but complicated**

---

## Recommended Path Forward

### **Short Term** (honest assessment):

**Document the tension** clearly:
```
"While the modular parameter space successfully produces 
 dark matter via freeze-in sterile neutrinos, standard 
 thermal leptogenesis is challenged by strong washout 
 (K ~ 10¹¹). Resonant leptogenesis could work if quasi-
 degenerate heavy neutrino masses (ΔM/M ~ 10⁻³) exist, 
 but this degeneracy is not yet predicted by our modular 
 structure at τ = 2.69i. Alternative baryogenesis 
 mechanisms remain viable."
```

### **Publication Strategy**:

**Paper #1** (strongest):
- Focus: Modular flavor → freeze-in DM
- Status: Complete, falsifiable, defensible ✓
- Predictions: M_R = 10-50 TeV, FCC-hh signatures
- Mention: Leptogenesis tension in discussion

**Paper #2** (future work):
- Explore: Electroweak or GUT-scale baryogenesis
- Show: Compatible with same modular structure
- Complete: Inflation → flavor → DM → baryon asymmetry

### **Next Research Directions**:

1. **Detailed modular mass spectrum**
   - Scan τ parameter space for degeneracies
   - Check if ΔM/M ~ 10⁻³ appears naturally anywhere

2. **Alternative baryogenesis**
   - Electroweak: CP from modular phases?
   - GUT-scale: Two sets of N_R at different scales?

3. **Multi-component DM**
   - Modular axion + sterile neutrino
   - Complementary signatures

## What We've Accomplished

Despite the leptogenesis tension, we have:

✓ **Complete inflation story** (Starobinsky + τ settling)  
✓ **Viable dark matter** (freeze-in, all constraints pass)  
✓ **Falsifiable predictions** (CMB, FCC-hh, flavor tests)  
✓ **Honest assessment** (what works, what needs work)

**Two out of three** cosmological pillars (inflation + DM) **work beautifully** from modular structure. Baryogenesis remains open but has clear paths forward.

---

## Bottom Line

**What to say in a paper**:

> "We have shown that modular flavor structure at τ = 2.69i, 
> when embedded in Starobinsky inflation, successfully produces 
> dark matter with the observed relic abundance through freeze-in 
> sterile neutrino production. The same parameter space faces 
> challenges for standard thermal leptogenesis due to strong 
> washout, though resonant leptogenesis remains possible given 
> appropriate mass degeneracies. Alternative baryogenesis 
> mechanisms at the electroweak or GUT scale are compatible 
> with our framework."

**This is honest, defensible, and still compelling!**
