# Planning Documents Archive

**Date**: December 31, 2025

This folder contains outdated planning documents that referenced a different paper structure than what was ultimately implemented.

---

## Historical Context

### Early Planning (Dec 2025)

Initial plans proposed:
- Paper 1: Lepton sector
- Paper 2: Quark sector (separate)
- Paper 3: Unified framework (combining leptons + quarks)
- Paper 4: String origin

### Actual Implementation (Current)

The final structure is:
- **Paper 1** (`manuscript/`): Flavor - leptons + quarks unified (19 parameters)
- **Paper 2** (`manuscript_cosmology/`): Cosmology - inflation, DM, baryogenesis, strong CP (6 observables)
- **Paper 3** (`manuscript_dark_energy/`): Dark energy - quintessence mechanism (3 observables)
- **Paper 4** (`manuscript_paper4_string_origin/`): String origin - geometric derivation

### Why the Change?

Combining leptons and quarks into Paper 1 was a better strategy:
- ✅ Single paper shows cross-sector consistency
- ✅ Stronger narrative (same τ = 2.69i for all flavor)
- ✅ Freed Papers 2-3 to cover cosmology and dark energy
- ✅ More attractive to journals (unified flavor paper)
- ✅ Avoids appearance of "salami-slicing" results

## What's Archived Here

Documents that reference the outdated "quark sector paper" or "unified framework paper" structure.

**Note**: Most framework documents in `docs/framework/` are CURRENT and correctly describe the actual implementation. Only specific planning documents that explicitly described the old structure should be moved here.

## Usage

These documents remain valuable for:
- Understanding research evolution
- Historical context for decisions
- Alternative approaches considered
- Future reference if needed

**If in doubt, trust the actual manuscripts in `manuscript*/` directories.**
